# VIN

## via OBD

VIN is correctly retrieved from Service 09 PID 2 request:

```
27.52245,1.0,2024,0.0,8,8,[16 20 73  2  1 51 78 49],0.0,1.0,2016,0.0,8,8,[ 2  9  2 85 85 85 85 85],1.0
27.525100000000002,1.0,352,0.0,7,7,[ 51 131  33   0   8 255 232   0],0.0,1.0,2016,0.0,8,8,[ 2  9  2 85 85 85 85 85],1.0
27.5253,1.0,384,0.0,8,8,[31 89 50 19 56  0 52 16],0.0,1.0,2016,0.0,8,8,[ 2  9  2 85 85 85 85 85],1.0
``````

"51 78 49" is "3N1" in ASCII. But, following characters in VIN sequence (67 78 55) don't appear until much later in the transactions list.

A DBC file to extract the VIN is needed

## via UDS

The VIN is also correctly received via UDS, using the Service 0x22 (34d) request "Read Data By Identifier" with Device Identifier 0xF190 (241d 144d)
